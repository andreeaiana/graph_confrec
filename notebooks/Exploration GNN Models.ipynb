Local search corresponds to the best response dynamics that arises when jobs selfishly try to minimize their costs. We assume that each machine runs a coordination mechanism that determines the order of execution of jobs assigned to it. We obtain various new polynomial and pseudo-polynomial bounds for the well-studied coordination mechanisms Makespan and Shortest-Job-First, using worst-case and smoothed analysis. We also introduce a natural coordination mechanism FIFO, which takes into account the order in which jobs arrive at a machine, and study both its impact on the convergence time and its price of anarchy.',\n",

Refactoring legacy code typically requires large efforts and introduces serious risks because often crucial business assets are hidden in legacy components. We investigate the support of formal techniques for the rejuvenation of legacy embedded software, concentrating on control components. Model learning and equivalence checking are used to improve a new implementation of a legacy control component. Model learning is applied to both the old and the new implementation. The resulting models are compared using an equivalence check of a model checker. We report about our experiences with this approach at Philips. By gradually increasing the set of input stimuli, we obtained implementations of a power control service for which the learned behaviour is equivalent.',\n",

       "  'In recent years, adverse drug reactions have drawn more and more attention from the public, which may lead to great damage to the public health and cause massive economic losses to our society. As a result, it becomes a great challenge to detect the potential adverse drug reactions before and after putting drugs into the market. With the development of the Internet, health-related social networks have accumulated large amounts of users’ comments on drugs, which may contribute to detect the adverse drug reactions. To this end, we propose a novel framework to detect potential adverse drug reactions based on health-related social networks. In our framework, we first extract mentions of diseases and adverse drug reactions from users’ comments using conditional random fields with different levels of features, and then filter the indications of drugs and known adverse drug reactions by external biomedical resources to obtain the potential adverse drug reactions. On the basis, we propose a modified Skip-gram model to discover associated proteins of potential adverse drug reactions, which will facilitate the biomedical experts to determine the authenticity of the potential adverse reactions. Extensive experiments based on DailyStrength show that our framework is effective for detecting potential adverse drug reactions from users’ comments.',\n",

       "  'Robust line matching across wide-baseline views is a challenging task in computer vision. Most of the existing methods highly depend on the positional relationships between lines and the associated textures. These cues are sensitive to various image transformations especially perspective deformations, and likely to fail in the scenarios where few texture present. In this paper, we construct a new coplanar line-points invariant upon a newly developed projective invariant, named characteristic number, and propose a line matching algorithm using the invariant. The construction of this invariant uses intersections of coplanar lines instead of endpoints, rendering more robust matching across views. Additionally, a series of line-points invariant values generate the similarity metric for matching that is less affected by mismatched interest points than traditional approaches. Accurate homography recovered from the invariant allows all lines, even those without interest points around them, a chance to be matched. Extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art validate the matching accuracy and robustness of the proposed method to projective transformations. The method also performs well for image pairs with few textures and similar textures.',\n",

       "  'The concept of “task” is at the core of artificial intelligence (AI): Tasks are used for training and evaluating AI systems, which are built in order to perform and automatize tasks we deem useful. In other fields of engineering theoretical foundations allow thorough evaluation of designs by methodical manipulation of well understood parameters with a known role and importance; this allows an aeronautics engineer, for instance, to systematically assess the effects of wind speed on an airplane’s performance and stability. No framework exists in AI that allows this kind of methodical manipulation: Performance results on the few tasks in current use (cf.\\xa0board games, question-answering) cannot be easily compared, however similar or different. The issue is even more acute with respect to artificial general intelligence systems, which must handle unanticipated tasks whose specifics cannot be known beforehand. A task theory would enable addressing tasks at the class level, bypassing their specifics, providing the appropriate formalization and classification of tasks, environments, and their parameters, resulting in more rigorous ways of measuring, comparing, and evaluating intelligent behavior. Even modest improvements in this direction would surpass the current ad-hoc nature of machine learning and AI evaluation. Here we discuss the main elements of the argument for a task theory and present an outline of what it might look like for physical tasks.',\n",

       "  'We consider randomized encodings (RE) that enable encoding a Turing machine \\\\(\\\\varPi \\\\) and input x into its “randomized encoding” \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\varPi }(x)\\\\) in sublinear, or even polylogarithmic, time in the running-time of \\\\(\\\\varPi (x)\\\\), independent of its output length. We refer to the former as sublinear RE and the latter as compact RE. For such efficient RE, the standard simulation-based notion of security is impossible, and we thus consider a weaker (distributional) indistinguishability-based notion of security: Roughly speaking, we require indistinguishability of \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\varPi }_0(x_0)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\varPi }_0(x_1)\\\\) as long as \\\\(\\\\varPi _0,x_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\varPi _1,x_1\\\\) are sampled from some distributions such that \\\\(\\\\varPi _0(x_0),\\\\mathsf{Time}({\\\\varPi _0}(x_0))\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\varPi _1(x_1),\\\\mathsf{Time}({\\\\varPi _1}(x_1))\\\\) are indistinguishable. We show the following: Impossibility in the Plain Model: Assuming the existence of subexponentially secure one-way functions, subexponentially-secure sublinear RE does not exists. (If additionally assuming subexponentially-secure \\\\(\\\\mathbf{iO } \\\\) for circuits we can also rule out polynomially-secure sublinear RE.) As a consequence, we rule out also puncturable \\\\(\\\\mathbf{iO } \\\\) for Turing machines (even those without inputs). Feasibility in the CRS model and Applications to iO for circuits: Subexponentially-secure sublinear RE in the CRS model and one-way functions imply \\\\(\\\\mathbf{iO } \\\\) for circuits through a simple construction generalizing GGM’s PRF construction. Additionally, any compact (even with sublinear compactness) functional encryption essentially directly yields a sublinear RE in the CRS model, and as such we get an alternative, modular, and simpler proof of the results of [AJ15, BV15] showing that subexponentially-secure sublinearly compact FE implies iO. We further show other ways of instantiating sublinear RE in the CRS model (and thus also iO): under the subexponential LWE assumption, it suffices to have a subexponentially secure FE schemes with just sublinear ciphertext (as opposed to having sublinear encryption time). Applications to iO for Unbounded-input Turing machines: Subexponentially-secure compact RE for natural restricted classes of distributions over programs and inputs (which are not ruled out by our impossibility result, and for which we can give candidate constructions) imply \\\\(\\\\mathbf{iO } \\\\) for unbounded-input Turing machines. This yields the first construction of \\\\(\\\\mathbf{iO } \\\\) for unbounded-input Turing machines that does not rely on (public-coin) differing-input obfuscation.',\n",

       "  'Attribute-based encryption (ABE) allows one-to-many encryption with static access control. In many occasions, the access control policy must be updated and the original encryptor might be required to re-encrypt the message, which is impractical, since the encryptor might be unavailable. Unfortunately, to date the work in ABE does not consider this issue yet, and hence this hinders the adoption of ABE in practice. In this work, we consider how to efficiently update access policies in Ciphertext-policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) systems without re-encryption. We introduce a new notion of CP-ABE supporting access policy update that captures the functionalities of attribute addition and revocation to access policies. We formalize the security requirements for this notion, and subsequently construct two provably secure CP-ABE schemes supporting AND-gate access policy with constant-size ciphertext for user decryption. The security of our schemes are proved under the Augmented Multi-sequences of Exponents Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption.',\n",

       "  'Public Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds are always multi-tenant. Applications from different tenants may reside on the same physical machine, which introduces the risk of sharing physical resources with a potentially malicious application. This gives the malicious application the chance to extract secret information of other tenants via side-channels. Though large numbers of researchers focus on the information extraction, there are few studies on the co-residence threat in public clouds, especially PaaS clouds. In this paper, we in detail studied the co-residence threat of public PaaS clouds. Firstly, we investigate the characteristics of different PaaS clouds and implement a memory bus based covert-channel detection method that works for various PaaS cloud platforms. Secondly, we study three popular PaaS clouds Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, IBM Bluemix and OpenShift, to identify the co-residence threat in their placement policies. We evaluate several placement variables (e.g., application type, number of the instances, time launched, data center region, etc.) to study their influence on achieving co-residence. The results show that all the three PaaS clouds are vulnerable to the co-residence threat and the application type plays an important role in achieving co-residence on container-based PaaS clouds. At last, we present an efficient launch strategy to achieve co-residence with the victim on public PaaS clouds.',\n",

The RGB images computed directly from the camera sensor data, called RAW images, retain the entire dynamic range of the sensor, however, they suffer from visible noise in dark regions. In this work we evaluate visibility of this noise in a perceptual experiment, in which people manually mark differences between a single-shot camera RAW image and a corresponding high quality image - the high dynamic range photograph created using the multi-exposure technique. We also show that the HDR-VDP-2 image quality metric can be efficiently applied to automatically detect noisy regions without the need for time-consuming experiments.',\n",

This is different from traditional semantic segmentation over a predefined set of semantic classes, as e.g., the phrase “two men sitting on the right bench” requires segmenting only the two people on the right bench and no one standing or sitting on another bench. Previous approaches suitable for this task were limited to a fixed set of categories and/or rectangular regions. To produce pixelwise segmentation for the language expression, we propose an end-to-end trainable recurrent and convolutional network model that jointly learns to process visual and linguistic information. In our model, a recurrent neural network is used to encode the referential expression into a vector representation, and a fully convolutional network is used to a extract a spatial feature map from the image and output a spatial response map for the target object. We demonstrate on a benchmark dataset that our model can produce quality segmentation output from the natural language expression, and outperforms baseline methods by a large margin.',\n",

Although OWL ontologies are well-used for representing and reasoning about knowledge in various domains, they are sparsely studied for visual language specification. The work in this paper, therefore, explores OWL for visual language specification by specifying the concrete syntax of selected UML class diagram notations in an ontology. The selected diagram notations are specified as spatial configurations of primitive elements and qualitative base spatial relationships of Region Connection Calculus-8 (RCC-8). Furthermore, the automated reasoning features of ontology reasoners are investigated to verify the completeness and the correctness of the specification. The verification results indicate that the given specification needs to be revised to support applications to draw the selected notations. The value of such a specification in supporting a semantic diagram interpretation application is demonstrated using the automated instance classification feature of ontology reasoners.',\n",

To evaluate our prediction of hypomimia score for participants not included in the training set, we computed the score’s correlation with hypomimia scores provided by 2 neurologists. The correlations in 4 conditions were 0.84,\\xa00.69,\\xa00.71,\\xa00.70. This should be compared with the correlation between the somewhat subjectives scores of the two neurologists, which is 0.78. When training classifiers to discriminate between people who suffer from hypomimia and people who do not, the area under the curve of the corresponding Receiver Operating Characteristic curves in the same 4 conditions is \\\\(0.90-0.99\\\\).

       "  'Parsing articulated objects, e.g. humans and animals, into semantic parts (e.g. head, body and arms, etc.) from natural images is a challenging and fundamental problem in computer vision. A big difficulty is the large variability of scale and location for objects and their corresponding parts. Even limited mistakes in estimating scale and location will degrade the parsing output and cause errors in boundary details. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a “Hierarchical Auto-Zoom Net” (HAZN) for object part parsing which adapts to the local scales of objects and parts. HAZN is a sequence of two “Auto-Zoom Nets” (AZNs), each employing fully convolutional networks for two tasks: (1) predict the locations and scales of object instances (the first AZN) or their parts (the second AZN); (2) estimate the part scores for predicted object instance or part regions. Our model can adaptively “zoom” (resize) predicted image regions into their proper scales to refine the parsing. We conduct extensive experiments over the PASCAL part datasets on humans, horses, and cows. In all the three categories, our approach significantly outperforms alternative state-of-the-arts by more than \\\\(5\\\\,\\\\%\\\\) mIOU and is especially better at segmenting small instances and small parts. In summary, our strategy of first zooming into objects and then zooming into parts is very effective. It also enables us to process different regions of the image at different scales adaptively so that we do not need to waste computational resources scaling the entire image.',\n",

       "  'In this paper, we consider the problem of fully automatic brain tumor segmentation in multimodal magnetic resonance images. In contrast to applying classification on entire volume data, which requires heavy load of both computation and memory, we propose a two-stage approach. We first normalize image intensity and segment the whole tumor by utilizing the anatomy structure information. By dilating the initial segmented tumor as the region of interest (ROI), we then employ the random forest classifier on the voxels, which lie in the ROI, for multi-class tumor segmentation. Followed by a novel pathology-guided refinement, some mislabels of random forest can be corrected. We report promising results obtained using BraTS 2015 training dataset.',\n",

       "  'This paper presents a novel method of generating and evaluating linguistic summaries of content stored in distributed graph datasets, like LinkedData. Linguistic summarization is a well known data mining technique, aimed to discover patterns in data and present them in natural language. So far, this method has been researched only for relational databases. In our recent paper we have presented how to adapt this method for graph datasets. We have solved the problems of subject definition (further extended in this paper), retrieval of the attributes for summarization, generalization of summarizers and qualifiers. In this paper we extend that research by adapting proposed method to distributed interlinked graph datasets, which results in obtaining new summaries, and therefore new knowledge. We discuss how to follow different types of equivalence links that may exists between graph datasets. In order to measure characteristics specific for summaries of distributed graph data we propose new truth values (degree of subject appropriateness, degree of summarizer order and degree of linkage), and adapt existing ones (degree of covering). We run several experiments on Linked Data and discuss the results.',\n",

       "  'Feature modeling is a widely accepted variability modeling technique for supporting decision-making scenarios, by representing decisions as features. However, there are scenarios where domain concepts have multiple implementation alternatives that have to be analyzed from large-scale data sources. Therefore, a manual selection of an optimal solution from within the alternatives space or even the complete representation of the domain is an unsuitable task. To solve this issue, we created a feature modeling metamodel and two specific processes to represent domain and implementation alternative models, and to search for optimal solutions whilst considering a set of optimization objectives. We applied this approach to a cloud computing case study and obtained an optimal provider configuration for deploying a JEE application.',\n",

The root of this problem arises from an inherent structural concept of restricted responsibilities and the lack of trust from the cloud users’ perspective. This work introduces a conceptual approach to user-centric policy management for cloud usage, combined with an underpinning holistic trust approach. Trust has to be established as a separate infrastructural concept determining the level of user adjustability. This approach outlines how provisioning cloud users’ policies is combined with agent-based trust establishment. An ontology-driven regulation concept enables formal policy definitions and trustworthy real-time reasoning about current trust levels, policy states, and pending security risks.',\n",

We show that although the shortest synchronizing word for an NWA, if it exists, can be (at most) exponential in the size of the NWA, the existence of such a word can still be decided in polynomial time. As our main contribution, we show that deciding the existence of a short synchronizing word (of at most given length) becomes PSPACE-complete (as opposed to NP-complete for DFA). The upper bound makes a connection to pebble games and Strahler numbers, and the lower bound goes via small-cost synchronizing words for DFA, an intermediate problem that we also show PSPACE-complete. We also characterize the complexity of a number of related problems, using the observation that the intersection nonemptiness problem for NWA is EXP-complete.',\n",

This removes unnecessary detail and reduces space consumption as well as computation time. This process is called snapping to the grid and has been investigated thoroughly from a computational-geometry perspective. In this paper we investigate the same problem for given drawings of planar graphs under the restriction that their combinatorial embedding must be kept and edges are drawn straight-line. We show that the problem is NP-hard for several objectives and provide an integer linear programming formulation.

In order to study the effect of providing the choice to skip feedback in an online tutor traditionally used in-natura, we conducted a controlled study in Fall 2015. Experimental group was given the choice to skip the worked example provided as feedback after the student had solved a problem incorrectly, whereas control group was not. We found that providing the choice did not lead to greater learning. Experimental group students needed marginally more problems to learn each concept, and their pre-post improvement was marginally less. When we analyzed skipping behavior, we found that neither the grade on a problem nor the grade on the prior problem on the same concept affected a student’s decision to read or skip feedback. Novelty of the concept on the other hand may prompt students not to skip feedback. Whether or not students skipped feedback on a problem did not affect their grade on the next problem on the same concept. Students were just as likely to skip as not skip feedback on the various problems. Some students tended to skip far more than others.',\n",

In this paper, we design a simple extension of NI-MAC, called \\\\(\\\\mathrm{NI}^{+}\\\\)-MAC, and prove that it has security bound beyond birthday (BBB) of order \\\\(O(q^2\\\\ell ^2 / 2^{2n})\\\\) provided \\\\(\\\\ell \\\\le 2^{n/4}\\\\). Our construction not only lifts the security of NI-MAC beyond birthday, it also reduces the number of keys from 2 (NI uses 2 independent keys) to 1. Before this work, Yasuda had proposed [FSE 2008] a single fixed-keyed compression function based BBB-secure MAC with security bound \\\\(O(\\\\ell q^2/2^{2n})\\\\) that uses an extra mask, and requires a storage space to store the mask.

An interaction robot is required the many rules to take suitable action. But, It is difficult to provide rules based on all situations. Now, we focus on a cleanup service by a robot, and are developing an interaction robot which estimates the storage place where a robot should carry objects. In this system, an interaction robot has to know the relationship of the objects and the storage places in dynamically changing situation. Therefore, we propose the Multi-Layer Situation Map, and express the relationship between the object and the storage place. The multi-layer situation map can move each component using a spring model. To verify the effectivity of the multi-layer situation map, we have performed the simulation experiment. We discuss about the dynamically situation change when the same objects are exist on the table.',\n",

       "  'We have expected that dynamic higher functions such as “thinking” emerge through the growth from exploration in the framework of reinforcement learning (RL) using a chaotic Neural Network (NN). In this frame, the chaotic internal dynamics is used for exploration and that eliminates the necessity of giving external exploration noises. A special RL method for this framework has been proposed in which “traces” were introduced. On the other hand, reservoir computing has shown its excellent ability in learning dynamic patterns. Hoerzer et al. showed that the learning can be done by giving rewards and exploration noises instead of explicit teacher signals. In this paper, aiming to introduce the learning ability into our new RL framework, it was shown that the memory-required task in the work of Hoerzer et al. could be learned without giving exploration noises by utilizing the chaotic internal dynamics while the exploration level was adjusted flexibly and autonomously. The task could be learned also using “traces”, but still with problems.',\n",

       "  'As we move toward pre-Exascale systems, two of the DOE leadership class systems will consist of very powerful OpenPOWER compute nodes which will be more complex to program. These systems will have massive amounts of parallelism; where threads may be running on POWER9 cores as well as on accelerators. Advances in memory interconnects, such as NVLINK, will provide a unified shared memory address spaces for different types of memories HBM, DRAM, etc. In preparation for such system, we need to improve our understanding on how OpenMP supports the concept of affinity as well as memory placement on POWER8 systems. Data locality and affinity are key program optimizations to exploit the compute and memory capabilities to achieve good performance by minimizing data motion across NUMA domains and access the cache efficiently. This paper is the first step to evaluate the current features of OpenMP 4.0 on the POWER8 processors, and on how to measure its effects on a system with two POWER8 sockets. We experiment with the different affinity settings provided by OpenMP 4.0 to quantify the costs of having good data locality vs not, and measure their effects via hardware counters. We also find out which affinity settings benefits more from data locality. Based on this study we describe the current state of art, the challenges we faced in quantifying effects of affinity, and ideas on how OpenMP 5.0 should be improved to address affinity in the context of NUMA domains and accelerators.',\n",

Therefore this community of person require more and more attention from researchers and precisely SLMT (Sign Language Machine Translation) researchers to be able to practice their natural right which is communication with other person. In this context the research laboratory LaTICE of the University of Tunis lunched science many years the project WebSign [1] aiming to translate automatically a written text to sign language whatever the language as input (English, French, Arabic, etc.). WebSign is a Web application. It is based on the technology of avatar (animation in virtual world). The input of the system is a text in natural language. The output is a real-time and online interpretation in sign language. This interpretation is constructed thanks to a dictionary of word and signs. The creation of this dictionary can be made in an incremental way by users who propose signs corresponding to words [2]. Our work as a part of this project aims to develop a translation module from Arabic text to Sign Language to be integrated in the WebSign project. This module offers to Arab Deaf and hearing people a tool facilitating their communication. Anyone can use this tool to translate an Arabic written text to Arabic Sign Language (ArSL). In fact in this level, it’s very useful to define a transcription system for Arabic Sign Language based on Arabic Gloss. This intermediate annotation system is a textual representation of sign language that covers the different parameters of the sign with a simplified representation to avoid the complexity of understanding [3].',\n",

       "  'Bitmap images of arbitrary dimension may be formally perceived as unions of m-dimensional boxes aligned with respect to a rectangular grid in Open image in new window. Cohomology and homology groups are well known topological invariants of such sets. Cohomological operations, such as the cup product, provide higher-order algebraic topological invariants, especially important for digital images of dimension higher than 3. If such an operation is determined at the level of simplicial chains [see e.g. González-Díaz, Real, Homology, Homotopy Appl, 2003, 83–93], then it is effectively computable. However, decomposing a cubical complex into a simplicial one deleteriously affects the efficiency of such an approach. In order to avoid this overhead, a direct cubical approach was applied in [Pilarczyk, Real, Adv. Comput. Math., 2015, 253–275] for the cup product in cohomology, and implemented in the ChainCon software package [http://www.pawelpilarczyk.com/chaincon/]. We establish a formula for the Steenrod square operations [see Steenrod, Annals of Mathematics. Second Series, 1947, 290–320] directly at the level of cubical chains, and we prove the correctness of this formula. An implementation of this formula is programmed in C++ within the ChainCon software framework. We provide a few examples and discuss the effectiveness of this approach. One specific application follows from the fact that Steenrod squares yield tests for the topological extension problem: Can a given map \\\\(A\\\\rightarrow S^d\\\\) to a sphere \\\\(S^d\\\\) be extended to a given super-complex X of A? In particular, the ROB-SAT problem, which is to decide for a given function Open image in new window and a value \\\\(r>0\\\\) whether every Open image in new window with \\\\(\\\\Vert g-f\\\\Vert _\\\\infty \\\\le r\\\\) has a root, reduces to the extension problem.',\n",

However, past experience shows that cryptographic primitives do not last forever: increased computational power and advanced cryptanalysis cause primitives to break frequently, and motivate the development of new ones. It is therefore crucial for maintaining trust in a cryptocurrency to anticipate such breakage. We present the first systematic analysis of the effect of broken primitives on Bitcoin. We identify the core cryptographic building blocks and analyze the ways in which they can break, and the subsequent effect on the main Bitcoin security guarantees. Our analysis reveals a wide range of possible effects depending on the primitive and type of breakage, ranging from minor privacy violations to a complete breakdown of the currency. Our results lead to several observations on, and suggestions for, the Bitcoin migration plans in case of broken or weakened cryptographic primitives.',\n",

Nevertheless, there are still some important issues that have not been discussed in the literature yet. In the first part of this two-part contribution we deal with the concept of regularization, a quite standard technique from machine learning applied so as to increase the fit quality on test and validation data samples. Due to the constraints on the weighting vector, it turns out that quite different methods can be used in the current framework, as compared to regression models. Moreover, it is worth noting that so far fitting weighted quasi-arithmetic means to empirical data has only been performed approximately, via the so-called linearization technique. In this paper we consider exact solutions to such special optimization tasks and indicate cases where linearization leads to much worse solutions.',\n",

Based on study and analysis of different facial features, the development of an accurate and efficient gender recognition system is an ultimate requirement for different useful applications such as surveillance, design of entrance and exit protocols at shopping malls, browsing of gender specific advertisement material on internet, etc. The gender recognition is essentially a binary classification process in which an input image is reported either true or false gender of the person in question. In this paper, we propose a knowledge based gender recognition system using histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and local binary descriptor (namely LBP, Brisk and FREAK) based features, which can be used in robotics etc. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that Brisk and FREAK based features are used for the gender recognition problem. To evaluate our proposed system, we use standard IMM gender database (of 240 images) to extracted features and train (and test) the K nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier. Our results show that the proposed gender recognition system outperforms the existing methods when tested on above mentioned database, by giving accuracy as high as 90\\xa0%for FREAK features, and 94.16\\xa0% for HOG feature, improved by 6.5\\xa0%.',\n",

       "  'Cloud computing breaks up the traditional value chain of IT provisioning and leads to new roles of market players acting in the ecosystem. Although there exist few publications on modeling the cloud computing ecosystem, each contains a different number and various types of roles. The goal of this research paper is, therefore, to perform a comparative analysis of the dominating cloud computing ecosystem models in order to develop a revised, more comprehensive model. After having excluded several roles assessed as being irrelevant and included the findings of eight interviews with experts from cloud computing service providers, the Passau Cloud Computing Ecosystem Model (PaCE Model) comprises 18 roles. This model serves as a basis to investigate whether each role can actually be covered by real actors and which typical role clusters prevail in practice. Practitioners can gain a deeper understanding of the ecosystem’s complexity and recognize where they are situated and how they are related to each other.',\n",

For big data, however, a collective is often very large, a multi-stage approach can be used. In this paper we present an improvement of the two-stage consensus-based approach for determining the knowledge of a large collective. For this aim, clustering methods are used to classify a large collective into smaller ones. The first stage of consensus choice aims at determining the representatives of these smaller collectives. Then these representatives will be treated as the knowledge states of a new collective which will be the subject for the second stage of consensus choice. In addition, all the collectives will be checked for susceptibility to consensus in both stages of consensus choice process. Through experiments analysis, the improvement method is useful in minimizing the difference between single-stage and two-stage consensus choice approaches in determining the knowledge of a large collective.',\n",

This paper proposes a Semantic Web of Things Framework to improve the interoperability among domain-specific Web of Things applications by providing a unified WoT Knowledge Base construction framework. For this purpose, a Microdata vocabulary extended from Semantic Sensor Network ontology is proposed to facilitate manual annotation on HTML-based WoT representations. Moreover, to improve the scalability of extraction of semantics of structured Web of Things resources, a semi-automatic semantic annotation method based on entity linking model is also proposed. To testify the technical feasibility of the framework, a reference implementation and quantitative evaluation on annotation results are illustrated.',\n",

In this paper, we examined the design modifications necessary when porting PLASMA, a task-based dense linear algebra library, to run effectively on Intel’s Knights Corner Xeon Phi coprocessor. First, we modified PLASMA’s tiled Cholesky decomposition to use OpenMP for its scheduling mechanism to enable Xeon Phi compatibility. We then compared the performance of our modified code to that of the original dynamic scheduler running on an Intel Xeon Sandy Bridge CPU. Finally, we looked at the performance of the new OpenMP tiled Cholesky decomposition on a Knights Corner coprocessor. We found that desirable performance for this architecture was attainable with the right code optimizations; these changes were necessary to account for differences in the runtimes and in the hardware itself.',\n",

The main idea of our approach is to map control flow transitions into transactions. This way, violations of the intended control flow graphs would then trigger transactional aborts, which constitutes the core of our TSX-based CFI solution. To prove the feasibility of our technique, we designed and implemented two coarse-grained CFI proof-of-concept implementations using the new TSX features. In particular, we show how hardware-supported transactions can be used to enforce both loose CFI (which does not need to extract the control flow graph in advance) and strict CFI (which requires pre-computed labels to achieve a better precision). All solutions are based on a compile-time instrumentation. We evaluate the effectiveness and overhead of our implementations to demonstrate that a TSX-based implementation contains useful concepts for architectural control flow integrity support.',\n",

       "  'We consider the following basic task in the testing of concurrent systems. The input to the task is a partial order of events, which models actions performed on or by the system and specifies ordering constraints between them. The task is to determine if some scheduling of these events can result in a bug. The number of schedules to be explored can, in general, be exponential. Empirically, many bugs in concurrent programs have been observed to have small bug depth; that is, these bugs are exposed by every schedule that orders d specific events in a particular way, irrespective of how the other events are ordered, and d is small compared to the total number of events. To find all bugs of depth d, one needs to only test a d-hitting family of schedules: we call a set of schedules a d-hitting family if for each set of d events, and for each allowed ordering of these events, there is some schedule in the family that executes these events in this ordering. The size of a d-hitting family may be much smaller than the number of all possible schedules, and a natural question is whether one can find d-hitting families of schedules that have small size. In general, finding the size of optimal d-hitting families is hard, even for d\\xa0=\\xa02. We show, however, that when the partial order is a tree, one can explicitly construct d-hitting families of schedules of small size. When the tree is balanced, our constructions are polylogarithmic in the number of events.',\n",

In order to evaluate the malignancy of lung nodules, clinical practice often involves expert qualitative ratings on several criteria describing a nodule’s appearance and shape. Translating these features for computer-aided diagnostics is challenging due to their subjective nature and the difficulties in gaining a complete description. In this paper, we propose a computerized approach to quantitatively evaluate both appearance distinctions and 3D surface variations. Nodule shape was modeled and parameterized using spherical harmonics, and appearance features were extracted using deep convolutional neural networks. Both sets of features were combined to estimate the nodule malignancy using a random forest classifier. The proposed algorithm was tested on the publicly available Lung Image Database Consortium dataset, achieving high accuracy. By providing lung nodule characterization, this method can provide a robust alternative reference opinion for lung cancer diagnosis.',\n",

Actually, in the real world, it is likely that a data stream simultaneously has multiple concept drifts and an imbalanced class distribution. However, since most research approaches do not consider class imbalance and the concept drift problem at the same time, they probably have a good performance on the overall average accuracy, while the accuracy of the minority class is very poor. To deal with these challenges, this paper proposes a new weighting method which can further improve the accuracy of the minority class on the imbalanced data streams with concept drifts.

       "  'Stack underflow attacks against Java Card platform attempt to access undefined local variables or operands to corrupt data that are not supposed to be accessible. Indeed, their exploitations rely on changing system data (return address, execution of context, etc.). The current attacks are restricted to the main assumption that the frame system data is located between the operand stack and the local variable area. However, Java stacks are implementation dependent and their structures are not always in the above configuration. This article presents a new attack which does not rely on the Java stack implementation model and that exploits specific countermeasure omission during frame allocation. Nevertheless the attack relies on ill-formed application that does not undergo the Bytecode Verifier. In spite of that, it is well-known that fault injection can be used to turn harmless code sequence into malicious code. We then suggest a new combined attack that allows performing several type confusions with one fault model.',\n",

Classical music excerpts taken from opera overtures were used as stimuli to induce emotional variations across time between neutral and intense emotional states. Continuous ratings of arousal and valence along with cardiovascular, respiratory, skin conductance and facial expressive activity were recorded simultaneously. Results show that parts of the music with higher loudness and pulse clarity induced higher ratings of arousal, sympathetic activation and increased cardiorespiratory synchronization.

Possible applications include query sampling and the simulation of probabilistic spreading phenomena, as well as other scenarios where the probability of a connection between two entities decreases with their distance. We present a fast, sublinear-time query algorithm to sample probabilistic neighborhoods from planar point sets. For certain distributions of planar P, we prove that our algorithm answers a query in \\\\(O((|N(q,f)| + \\\\sqrt{n})\\\\log n)\\\\) time with high probability. In experiments this yields a speedup over pairwise distance probing of at least one order of magnitude, even for rather small data sets with \\\\(n=10^5\\\\) and also for other point distributions not covered by the theoretical results.',\n",

On the other hand, positive text regions cannot be measured in the same way as that for general objects at training. In this paper, we introduce a novel vertically-regressed proposal network (VRPN), which allows text regions to be matched by multiple neighboring small anchors.

Internally, SymDIVINE extends the standard explicit-state state space exploration with SMT machinery to handle non-deterministic data values. As such, SymDIVINE is on a halfway between a symbolic executor and an explicit-state model checker. The key differentiating aspect present in SymDIVINE is the ability to decide about equality of two symbolically represented states preventing thus repeated exploration of the state space graph. This is crucially important in particular for verification of parallel programs where the state space graph is full of diamond-shaped subgraphs.',\n",

       "  'Website Fingerprinting attacks enable a passive eavesdropper to recover the user’s otherwise anonymized web browsing activity by matching the observed traffic with prerecorded web traffic templates. The defenses that have been proposed to counter these attacks are impractical for deployment in real-world systems due to their high cost in terms of added delay and bandwidth overhead. Further, these defenses have been designed to counter attacks that, despite their high success rates, have been criticized for assuming unrealistic attack conditions in the evaluation setting. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight defense based on Adaptive Padding that provides a sufficient level of security against website fingerprinting, particularly in realistic evaluation conditions. In a closed-world setting, this defense reduces the accuracy of the state-of-the-art attack from 91\\xa0% to 20\\xa0%, while introducing zero latency overhead and less than 60\\xa0% bandwidth overhead. In an open-world, the attack precision is just 1\\xa0% and drops further as the number of sites grows.',\n",

       "  'In this paper we consider online auctions with buyback; a form of auctions where bidders arrive sequentially and the bidders have to be accepted or rejected immediately. Each bidder has a valuation for being allocated the good and a preemption price. Sold goods can be bought back from the bidders for a preemption price. We allow unbounded valuations and preemption prices independent from each other. We study the clairvoyant model, a model sitting between the traditional offline and online models. In the clairvoyant model, a sequence of all potential customers (their bids and compensations) is known in advance to the seller, but the seller does not know when the sequence stops. In the case of a single good, we present an algorithm for computing the difficulty \\\\(\\\\varDelta \\\\), the optimal ratio between the clairvoyant mechanism and the pure offline mechanism (which knows when the sequence stops, and can simply sell the good to the customer with the highest bid, without having to pay any compensations). We also present an optimal clairvoyant mechanism if there are multiple goods to be sold. If the number of goods is unbounded, however, we show that the problem in the clairvoyant model becomes \\\\(\\\\mathcal {NP}\\\\)-hard. Based on our results in the clairvoyant model, we study the \\\\(\\\\varDelta \\\\)-online problem (where the sequence is unknown to the mechanism, but the difficulty \\\\(\\\\varDelta \\\\) of the input sequence is known). We show that there is a tight gap of \\\\(\\\\varTheta (\\\\varDelta ^5)\\\\) between the offline and the online model.',\n",

       "  'Nowadays, in many speech processing tasks, such as speech recognition and synthesis, really large speech corpora are utilized. These speech corpora usually contain several hours of speech or even more. To\\xa0achieve possibly best results, an appropriate annotation of the recorded utterances is often necessary. This paper is focused on problems related to the prosodic annotation of the Czech speech corpora. In the Czech language, the utterances are supposed to be split by pauses into so-called prosodic clauses containing one or more prosodic phrases. The types of\\xa0particular phrases are linked to their last prosodic words corresponding to various functionally involved prosodemes. The clause/phrase structure is substantially determined by the sentence composition. However, in real speech data, different prosodeme type or even phrase/clause borders can be present. This paper deals with 2\\xa0basic problems: the correction of\\xa0the improper prosodeme/phrase type and the detection of new phrase borders. For both tasks, we proposed new procedures utilizing hidden Markov models. Experiments were performed on 4\\xa0large speech corpora recorded by professional speakers for the purpose of speech synthesis. These experiments were limited to the declarative sentences. The results were successfully verified by listening tests.',\n",

       "  'All previous constructions of general multiparty computation protocols that are secure against adaptive corruptions in the concurrent setting either require some form of setup or non-standard assumptions. In this paper we provide the first general construction of secure multi-party computation protocol without any setup that guarantees composable security in the presence of an adaptive adversary based on standard polynomial-time assumptions. We prove security under the notion of “UC with super-polynomial helpers” introduced by Canetti et al. (FOCS 2010), which is closed under universal composition and implies “super-polynomial-time simulation”. Moreover, our construction relies on the underlying cryptographic primitives in a black-box manner. Next, we revisit the zero-one law for two-party secure functions evaluation initiated by the work of Maji, Prabhakaran and Rosulek (CRYPTO 2010). According to this law, every two-party functionality is either trivial (meaning, such functionalities can be reduced to any other functionality) or complete (meaning, any other functionality can be reduced to these functionalities) in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. As our second contribution, assuming the existence of a simulatable public-key encryption scheme, we establish a zero-one law in the adaptive setting. Our result implies that every two-party non-reactive functionality is either trivial or complete in the UC framework in the presence of adaptive, malicious adversaries.',\n",
